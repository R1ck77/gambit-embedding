#+TITLE Gambit-C embedding test
#+LANGUAGE en

A small test project to explore how hard (or hopefully easyâ€¦) it is to embed a Scheme interpreter in a C program using Gambit-C.

The code is expected to test:

- embedding, as the execution of a Scheme snippet with I/O from and to C
- extending, the addition of a "module" with C code
